Random thoughts from looking at the code

He is randomizing the leapfrom steps:
	// randomize the number of steps
	double rnd2=randn(rng);
	int hnsteps=hybnstep*exp(.2*rnd2);
If user doens't enter a valid nmcmc, it defaults to 100000 which is way to
high

mcsave doens't do anything, is alwasy set to 1!!

It's programmed to have a backward leapfrog, but is turned off. Was this
just for testing?
